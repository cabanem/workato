# Roadmap

## Near Term (1–2 sprints)
- Thresholding to abstain when evidence is weak.
- Hybrid search (BM25 + dense) with weighted fusion.
- Section titles and anchor fragments in citations.
- Packaging as a Docker image; helm chart for k8s.

## Mid Term (3–6 sprints)
- UI web app with feedback loop (thumbs up/down + comment).
- Multi-site ingestion and per-site indices.
- Evaluation harness with automatic nightly report.

## Long Term
- Structured extraction (entities, schemas, commands).
- Long-context models to reduce chunk count and overlap.
- Multi-lingual ingestion and query translation.
